# Algorithmic-Trip-Chartering
This project focused on optimizing air taxi trip assignments using a greedy algorithm that minimizes wait times and ensures sufficient battery levels for each trip. The simulation incorporated demand modeling with Poisson distribution, trip scheduling, and battery management, providing an efficient foundation for real-time air taxi dispatching.
