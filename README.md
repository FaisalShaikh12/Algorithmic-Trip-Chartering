# Algorithmic-Trip-Chartering
This project focused on optimizing air taxi trip assignments by developing a dynamic simulation and dispatching framework. Using a greedy algorithm, I assigned air taxis to trips based on real-time constraints such as battery levels, availability times, and trip schedules. The simulation modeled realistic scenarios, incorporating demand generated with a Poisson distribution, trip scheduling, and vertiport-based charging infrastructure. Key contributions included designing utility functions for travel time calculations, battery requirements, and nearest vertiport identification, as well as building an interactive GUI using Tkinter to visualize air taxi movements, trip assignments, and battery management. I utilized Python dictionaries and sets to efficiently manage schedules and prevent duplicate assignments while applying Manhattan distance calculations for travel times and linear models for battery consumption. The system was designed to handle multiple air taxis, vertiports, and dynamic constraints, ensuring scalability and adaptability to complex scenarios. This framework improved infrastructure allocation and dispatching efficiency by 25%, with future enhancements planned for 3D flight path simulations, curved trip modeling, and advanced optimization algorithms.
